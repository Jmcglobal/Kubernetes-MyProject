## EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
It allows users to quickly and easily create and manage Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. EKS is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and highly available environment for running containerized applications. 
It provides a range of features, such as automated cluster scaling, automated patching, and integration with other AWS services. 
EKS also provides a range of security features, such as encryption at rest, IAM authentication, and network isolation.

# eksctl

This is a simple CLI tool for creating cluster on EKS - Amazon's new managed kubernetes service for EC2. It is written and uses CloudFormation.

# Configuring & deploying EKS using eksctl.

Just like KOPS am going to use BootStrapping instance, by launching ubuntu EC2 instance.
