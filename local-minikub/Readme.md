## Kubernetes config for,
- Kubernetes is an open source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes is designed to work with a range of container tools, including Docker, rkt, and CRI-O. It can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Kubernetes is used to manage containerized applications in a clustered environment, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. Kubernetes also provides a platform for deploying and managing applications in containers, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about underlying infrastructure. Kubernetes is designed to be highly extensible and provides support for a wide variety of containerized workloads.

## Deployment yaml file
- Kubernetes Deployment is an object that describes how an application should be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It describes how many replicas of an application should be running, which resources should be allocated, and where the application should be deployed. Deployment objects are used to declaratively manage the desired state of an application, rolling out updates and providing high availability for applications running on Kubernetes.

## Service Yaml file
- Kubernetes Service files are configuration files that describe how a Kubernetes service should be defined. A Service file defines the type of service, the ports that should be exposed, the selector used to determine which pods should be part of the service, and other information. A Service file is used by the kube-controller-manager to create and manage the service.

## Storage Yaml file:
- Storage class
- Persistent Volume
- Persistent Volume claim
